It is recommended that the kickstarter campaign begin in the month of June according to historical success rates.

Lastly, the mean funding targets specifically for musicals in United States show the below spread. Outliers above $13,000 were removed from this chart as these were deemed unrealistic for this project. The mean pledged amount was $2,483 with a mean goal of $3,600. This is higher than the median value in both cases showing the data does not have a normal distribution.

Based on these conclusions, it seems unlikely, but not impossible, that the campaign will be successful in reaching the $10,000 goal. Understanding specific efforts of "Good Bread Alley" and "Verdigris" in achieving the high number of backers could help with this target.
